In general bidirectional mapping causes problem of infinite fetch. In our example

When driver is called it calls Constructor then it calls Driver and it goes on

so use @JsonIgnore the class in which this is used the mapping kindof is removed and it wont get the other object directly.
Like in our case it is used in Driver as mostly from Constructor -> Driver is more needed and now Driver in general doesn't returns the Constructor.
